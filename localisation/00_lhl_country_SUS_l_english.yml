As we speaks, general Leakey does not have access to any significant classified information of ours, and currently considered only as a reserve commander, his defection would not hurt as in any mean.

For the time being, allocated funds already let Winchester university to fill its quotas up to the pre-turmoil capacity. Delight with the current BUUF successes, Japanese Royal Family had announced what they would triple their granted subsidies, in favor of the future program expansion to the universities Eastern England.\nThis is a well known fact what this move is a continuation of Japanese Royal tradition of choosing UK academies with the goal of getting Higher education.

To diminish currently unpayable cost of their ongoing projects, they sent a list of their non-hardcash related demands - Multiple advertisement campaigns, some law amendments, few exclusive political rights and other 'inconsiderable' request.

One of their demands is to be constantly supplied with volunteer test subjects. Considering to our current conditions, Tavistock expects to have even more test subjects then previous government supplied them with.\n'Volunteers with temporary, life or even death sentence, your most unloyal subjects and even voluntary participant would be welcomed to participate in our newly restablished facility.

Even before the current mutiny it was nothing but a huge pile of dead rails lying on the soil of the dying country. Constant waves of privatisation and nationalisation left nothing, but an unconnected web of an oversized trams.\nCurrently most of the working public services heavily depends of bustitution or short self-managed railway routes. But as Crown Agents increased their presence, most of the re-established trainways were occupied by their humanitarian missions. As they want to increase the effectiveness of their operations and to centralise our terminally ill mass transport, Crown Agency obligates us directly transfer control over all of the British railroads under their administration.\nAs one of the parts of our mutual contract states - \n''Recepient guarantees that any requested kind of transport* would be transfered under the Agency's jurisdiction up untill the end of the local humanitarian mission.''\n\n''*Which involves - automobile transport, ferry boats, railway locomotives and carriages, local and international aircrafts.
