 POLITICS_INTERREGNUM_DESC:0 "After demise of our great leader the whole delicate system what was established in London after Great Britain's collapse was ruined. Mosley's bootlickers, various band's cheiftains, opressed civillians, all those strats feasts in sweet anarchy.\n Who knows, maybe only other harsh leader can bring order back onto streets of Big Apple.\nWild horse is just a horse without rider and a leash."

 ESS_central_region_loyal:0 "Tower's Guards\nCurrent loyality level:§YNonexistant§!"
 ESS_central_region_loyal_text:0 "Great Tower of London, its surroundings, and a huge area of Theme river is, for quite a long time, was not directly controlled by any of so-proclaimed Greater London's area rulers. Guarded by mix of rearmed Royal Yeomen Warders and remaining George VII's forces this Tower was unpenetrable. Supported and supplyed by local and abroad royal sympathizers, this castle would stand for ages. But everyone still know, what those guards only secure their own prison."
 ESS_central_region_band:0 "Dark Waters\nCurrent loyality level:§Y[?ESS_central_region_loyalty]§!"
 ESS_central_region_band_text:0 "Darkwaters, or 'Wherry Ones' are the true lords of river Thames and biggest ports of Essex. Veterans of the endless struggle on the Kent-bordering Tilbury port, and one of those few 'honorable' people, who prioritized London' food security over the more profitable drug and arms business, their river domain spreads from the estuary of the Thames river, up to the Tower Bridge, where they were once met with friendly gunfire from the King George's loyal forces. But as more and more of London comes under the boot of Mad Max, the entirety of Thames river bank can now enjoy fresh, overpriced food and other, even more overpriced, important goods"
 ESS_south_west_region_band:0 "Undergrounders\nCurrent loyality level:§Y[?ESS_south_west_region_loyalty]§!"
 ESS_south_west_region_band_text:0 "Undergrounders’ main domain for quite a long time were stations and tunnels of the Greater Lodon's Tube - a lifeline so vital for the city, its spoils fed the band for years. As time passed, and no other militant group encroached on Undergrounders’ subway lines, most of the London's inner trade, mail, human trafficking and smallarms workshops migrated under its busy roads and alleyways - right into the hands of the band. However, the recent developments forced the band to abandon their “mole-like” ways. The Crimson Prince crept further north, occupying southern London and plunging its territory into chaos. Left with no other choice, Max Mosley offered the Undergrounders a deal to completely overtake southern regions and establish order in the area. Seeing an opportunity at becoming something greater, the Unfergrounders gladly took the offer."

 ESS_south_east_region_band_text:0 "Sharpers, Peakers, or 'Vovvies' are one of the most humane bands in all of London and Mosley's domain. As traditional institutions collapsed, the band began overseeing the humanitarian needs of thelocals, which made them quite popular among the common folk of the capital city. Feeding the poor, helping the elderly, justly lynching the corrupt officials and providing security and supplies for schools and hospitals made them one of the most respected people in the entirety of the metropolitan area. Pay your taxes, sometimes its just that simple."
 ESS_north_west_region_band:0 "Rajas\nCurrent loyality level:§Y[?ESS_north_west_region_loyalty]§!"
 ESS_north_west_region_band_text:0 "Rajas, are less of a 'traditional' band, witha a  top-to-bottom hierarchy and a single leader, and more of a 'union' of different british ethnic mafias. The organization is controlled by a council of elected leaders from numerous enthic bands, whose representatives are called 'Gigs', 'Kings' or 'Rajas'. Most of these bands still maintain their overseas connections with their countries of origin, and rule over the trade flow of legal and 'legalized' goods, which are freely coming to London through both the enemy lines and the undeclared naval blockade from other European great powers."
 ESS_north_east_region_band:0 "Big B's\nCurrent loyality level:§Y[?ESS_north_east_region_loyalty]§!"
 ESS_north_east_region_band_text:0 "Big B's are a band that made up of English football mobs, whose origin can be traced back to endless pub fights of Greater London. They were one of the first militant groups who wished to replace the weak and useless 'anarchist autonomous zone of Greater London Area' with the centralized rule of a single patriotic strongman - a man worthy of his father's legacy, Max Mosley known by many Londoners as "Mad Max". B.B. still keeps their patriotic frenzy and armed militants, most of who now directly serve as Mosley's personal army, While the band is still recovering from the costly battles during the German 'capital rush', Big B's battle experience and fanaticism make up for their dwindling numbers. As long as they are respected and provided with supplies, they will serve us with loyalty and great vigor."

They often steal from civilians, rather than targeting things that we need. Overall, they're clearly a missed opportunity, and the issues they cause in their current state outweigh the benefits of their loot. As such, Max Mosley has acted to restrain and reorganize the bandit gangs in London, issuing a decree to enforce discipline, military-style hierarchy, and transform them into an assault force optimized for sabotage and raids targeting war materiel and infrastructure."

But despite all of that, their hope for the Royalists counterattack is almost gone by now.\n To finally prevent their actions in the heart of London, leaders of the local band of Dark Waters, considered for us two options on this question - To save the honor of the Tower's guards, and let them peacefully leave London up to their masters, for an obvious favor; Or just to fake a George's order to lay their arms and surrender to the local government."
