 EAG_EAST_CITY_HELP_PLEASE:0"§YREGION INFLUENCE MECHANIC:§!\n\nThis mechanic allows you to complete various beneficial projects. The currently accessible projects can be found under the §YAVAILABLE PROJECTS§! decision bar.\n\nStarting a project requires a certain budget. Region budget can be accumulated with §Opolitical power§! through the §YBUDGET DECISIONS§! options.\n\nOnce a project has been selected, a countdown will begin. At this point, you will be provided with new decision options under the §YCITY REQUESTS§! bar. You will be able to plead various regions of the country for their §GINFLUECNE§!. To successfully launch a project, you have to accumulate at least half the total amount of influence cities possess (the exact number will be displayed above the decision menu).\n\nWhile you can successfully lobby the desired project without convincing all six states, every state that doesn't vote in favour of the project will give you §R-2%§! stability, when the project is complete. \n\nYou can view the short description of the states, the amount of §GINFLUECNE§! they posses and what regions constitute the aformentioned region by pressing on the corresponding §YCOAT OF ARMS.§!\n\nThe §GINFLUECNE§! of a region can be increased by building §YINFRASTRUCTURE§!, §YCIVILIAN§! and §YMILITARY FACTORIES§! in the constituting states.\n\nOnce a month, one of the six states will ask you to lobby their own project. Their §GINFLUECNE§! will automatically be added to the total state §GINFLUECNE§! number. "
