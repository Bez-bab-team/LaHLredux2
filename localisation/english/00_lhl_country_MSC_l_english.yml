 POLITICS_PHILOSOPHER_KING_DESC:0 "§YBirth name:§!§W Unknown§!\n\n§YLore:§!§W And so, at the head stands the Philosopher King, who, accordingly, represents a being with no personality of its own. The Philosopher King, a philosophical Tsar, is essentially no different from the embodiment of this personal Angel. The king is both an Angel and the whole people. He is a true person, superior to both the individual and the collective or society. \n\nThe Philosopher King must be hidden. Moreover, his existence must be so intense that it transcends the limits of existence. He will act in not-acting (the Taoist ideal of the perfect ruler is he who performs inaction, or Wu-Wei). Considering his deep and profound connection to the apophatic, he will be inexistent in existing or, on the contrary, he will exist in not existing. The Philosopher King is as if he was not, and he is not as he is. He should be easy, transparent, always open to the abyss represented by him in the Tcardom. Perhaps he will communicate with his subjects from behind a curtain, from the depths of a cave, or even through an oracle. He should neither speak nor be silent, but instead only give signs. The Philosopher King operates with subtle signs, in semi-silence and soft regal whisper, as the meaning is transmitted as directly as the spirit blows.\n\n He is absolutely transparent, devoid of any individual properties. The personal in him should be so minute that it would be preferable to conceal everything reminiscent of it, including his body and his image. It would be better if no one could see the Philosopher King as something external. All should recognize him as an internal ruler, as the “guest within.”§!"
 POLITICS_DUGIN_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WTo be a revolutionary, he lacked the character of one. A book person with little to no real life experience, Aleksandr Gelyevich was born in 1962 in Moscow and has left the city for only a few times. His mother a professor and his father a colonel, he’s been among the privileged from the very beginning of his life. His whims and talents have even caused him to spend a while in a mental hospital. For some time, he used to be a singer-songwriter…\n\nCalled by his ill-wishers nothing short of a 'Demonic Genius', Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin is a pure manifestation of the National Bolshevik Party's erratic soul, torn between the two equally important goals of shocking the common folk and creating an utopia. \n\nAmong Aleksandr Gelyevich’s numerous successes are the peaceful reunification of Russia with some post-Soviet countries as well as signing a Pact of Amity with Germany, with the latter putting an end to the Anglo-Atlanticist world hegemony.\n\nHowever, this triumph was followed, unexpectedly for all, by Dugin’s isolation. It isn’t entirely clear whether it was caused by Yegor Letov losing all confidence in his long-time comrade or Dugin himself getting disappointed with National Bolshevism.\n\nLater on Dugin formed the 'Katechon' faction within the NBP. It was to stay away from the numerous conflicts plaguing the movement and dedicate itself to nothing but abstract philosophical undertakings with no care for any practical application. \n\nIn light of the recently sprung succession crisis, numerous NBP members have looked up to the long-forgotten patriarch, hoping he might manage to protect the revolution’s conquests.§!"
 POLITICS_INTERREGNUM_DESC:0 "§WWhere did it all go wrong?\n\nIn 1993, the events that later came to be known as the "Black October" seemed like another painful challenge for the fledgling, broken Russian state. Nevertheless, the constitutional crisis proved to be a rebirth, not a funeral. Like a fiery, wrathful phoenix, the new Russia under the leadership of the national-bolshevik party tore its claws into the neoliberal "End of History", ripping it to shreds. Thirty years later, Eurasia stood atop the world stage as the new global hegemon, a true superpower with all its rivals vanquished or reduced to local powers of no significant importance. States from Tokyo to Lisbon bowed to the leadership of Jegor Letov and the vision of national-bolshevism.\n\nAlas, it turned out that the rise of Eurasia was as meteoric as its fall. After the death of Letov and an attempted coup by Alexandr Lukashenko, the once seemingly invincible empire collapsed into a bloody civil war. What remains of the loyalist forces under the leadership of Moscow were reduced to a couple of regions in Central Russia. Enemies surround the capital from all sides with Lukashenko preparing for another thrust in his Belorussian fortress, radicals from Russian National Unity making it all the way to Sergijev Posad, and rumors of the previously missing former president Dmitrij Medvedev starting an insurrection in Voronezh. The situation within the walls of the Kremlin isn't much better. The three remaining leaders of the Eurasianist cause - Alexandr Dugin, Gejdar Dzhemal’ and Aleksej Naval’nyj bicker amongst themselves, trying to decide who will lead the country in this dire situation.\n\nTime is running out. Unless the last faithful sons of Eurasia put aside their differences and unite behind one single vision, the once great new Russia shall find itself alongside its predecessors - in the dustbin of history.§!"
