 POLITICS_TSOJ_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WThirty years ago Viktor Robertovich Tsoj narrowly escaped death. An "Ikarus 250" bus almost collided with his car on a Latvian highway, but the musician was able to escape his untimely demise at the last second. The next few years felt like an endless swirl of dramatic events - the collapse of the country, his membership in the National Bolshevik Party, the 1993 coup attempt by Jel'tsin, which was squandered in no small part thanks to his music, the rise of Eurasia and the subsequent reunification with the "lost" republics.\n\nBy the year 2000 Tsoj was burned out from the busy political life of the Kremlin and announced his departure from the party. The NBP no longer felt like an avant-garde force of eternal bustling youth, but as a slow, unwieldy bureaucratic machine reminiscent of the late CPSU, something Tsoj himself fought against many years ago. The former musician moved to the Far East, aiming to visit the lands of his origin, giving incognito concerts in small bars and clubs along the way. Ultimately Viktor ended up settling down on the Sakhalin island - as far as possible from the political intrigue and his former fame.\n\nHowever, "change" has once again come to Russian land. A bloody civil war consumes the country and Viktor sees no other choice but to come out of hiding and unite the suffering people of Sakhalin under his charismatic persona. Once again, Viktor Robertovich Tsoj is on the brink of death. Surrounded on a small island with limited resources and tyrants from the continent aiming to enslave people loyal to him and then the rest of former Eurasia. However this time the musician doesn't intend to run away. Viktor Tsoj shall save those whose hearts desire change and lead them to the long-forgotten dream of freedom.§!"
