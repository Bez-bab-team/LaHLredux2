 POLITICS_STERLIGOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WTrying to enumerate all the events and projects German L’vovich Sterligov was more or less responsible for would inevitably produce a truly tremendous list. Over the course of his life, he owned around ten law firms, spent a while as a mortician, dabbled in political activism and even was, for some time, the head of a Gentry Assembly.\n\nGerman L’vovich has tried to persuade the NBP’s Council to shift to a gold standard, started the world’s first cryptocurrency exchange and even founded a private military company tasked with asymmetric warfare against Eduard Limonov’s allies in Africa.\n\nEvery single one of those undertakings turned out to be a failure. Sterligov is a hopeless enthusiast whose numerous endeavors are motivated by his insatiable passion for exploring new horizons, not by profit-seeking or cravings for glory. He’s a man fishing in uncharted waters, and the anarchy that swept Eurasia is, as far as he’s concerned, not a catastrophe but a chance. But at first, Sterligov will have to decide if his loyalties lie with the government in Moscow, or if his little fiefdom in Mozhajsk will carve its own path in this weird new world.§!"
