 POLITICS_BARKASHOW_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WAleksandr Petrovich Barkashov was born in a working-class family near Moscow in 1953. He spent a significant part of his youth in the army (which left an indelible imprint on his personality), later worked as a locksmith (without much success), taught karate and learned blacksmithing.\n\nIn the year 1990, together with the former supporters of “Pamyat'” society, Barkashov created the right-wing radical organization Russian National Unity, which would later take side with the Communists during the 1993 constitutional crisis.\n\nDuring the next three years, RNU would become one of the most relevant political forces in Russia. Their ranks, made up of thousands of retired military men, formed militias that dominated the streets at all times. Some say it was Barkashov who ultimately completely destroyed any hope Boris Jel’tsin had for a successful presidential run in 1996. However, with the advent of the National Bolsheviks, the Russian Nation Unity slowly, yet surely lost credibility and fell into the margins of political life.\n\nThe crisis years of Dmitrij Medvedev’s reign gave a new life to RNU with numerous young nationalists joining the organization. During the first days of the civil war, while the Eurasian authorities were busy with the advancing armies of Lukashenko, Barkashev’s militias started a “Cross Procession" that intended to topple the regime in Moscow. Beginning their crusade in Divejevo - the lot of the Virgin Mary, RNU forces made it all the way to Sergijev Posad, stopping at the gates of Moscow due to fierce resistance from the loyalists.\n\nSoon enough, however, the Russian National Unity shall once again push forward and return the capital of Russia to its rightful owners. Unfortunately for Aleksandr Barkashov, he no longer has the former influence on his stormtroopers as thirty years ago, and is forced to share power with a number of young and ambitious leaders. It is up for debate who will lead the true patriots of Russia in this new, glorious age.§!"
