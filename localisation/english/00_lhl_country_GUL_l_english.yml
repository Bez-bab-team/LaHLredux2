All of this was achieved due to the efforts of a single man - the mysterious Uncle.\n\nWhile no one knows his name and no one can be sure if they have ever seen the Uncle, this person managed to build a network of connections all other Siberia right from his prison cell, building a militia, numbers and fervor of which make it comparable to a professional army, and bringing some allies outside of Eurasia to help the growing rebellion.\n\nHiding in shadows, the Uncle keeps a mysterious aura around himself and his closest circle, but his successes on the battlefield assure the men under his banner that he would become a great leader of free Eurasia, once the glorious Liberation Front achieves its victory.§!"
