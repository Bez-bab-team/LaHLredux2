 POLITICS_TALKOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WIn the vast rock music scene of the late Soviet Union, few stood out as much as Igor’ Vladimirovich Tal'kov. Starting his career with the song "Clean Ponds'', which became a breakout hit in 1987, Tal'kov quickly became a household name throughout the Union. Igor’s opposition to the decaying bureaucratic apparatus of the Soviet Union, his socially relevant lyrics and passion for pre-revolutionary Russia resonated with people all over the USSR.\n\nIt all came crashing down in the 1990's, when stagnation and decay turned into a total collapse of all government and societal institutions. Freedom from the oppression of the malevolent and barbaric CPSU, which Tal'kov preached, has finally come, but what came next nearly destroyed Russia. While other ex-soviet rock-stars such as Jegor Letov or Viktor Tsoj "adjusted" their lyrics to keep up with the times, Tal'kov continued his steadfast crusade against the communists and bureaucrats. The impoverished and starving Russian masses, however, no longer found Igor’'s music as soothing, and Tal'kov’s career started to slowly wane. The final nail in the coffin was hammered in 1993, when the rockstar very publicly supported Boris Jel'tsin’s coup attempt against the Supreme Soviet, which tarnished Igor’'s reputation. After the rise of the National-Bolshevik Party and their subsequent geopolitical victories, Tal'kov faded into obscurity.\n\nFor the next 30 years, the musician witnessed the red-brown disease consume Russia, pulling it away from its European and imperial roots. Tal'kov's pleas towards the people fell on deaf ears and Igor’ ultimately isolated himself from the world. Burrowed in his own thoughts, the musician got invested into mysticism and religious studies, constructing his own worldview - one filled with "Black" and "White" forces that influence the world and "holes" present in the Earth's energy field.\n\nWhen the Eurasian civil war broke out Tal'kov aligned himself and few of his remaining followers with the "Sanitary Cordon" in Southern Russia - a loose alliance of cliques focused on containing Vladimir Putin - the enigmatic head of Rosgvardiya. Tal'kov doesn't really care that much though. For the former musician this war is a chance to finally reforge Russia in his own vision.\n\nMaybe when all of this is over he will finally truly return to a country of geniuses, not fools.§!"
