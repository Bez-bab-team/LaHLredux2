 POLITICS_FYODOROV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, to Jevgenij Fyodorov it seemed like the world itself had ended. A deputy of the Leningrad Oblast’ Council and an Afghan war veteran, Fyodorov wasn't a staunch communist, but the death of the USSR meant that encroaching western powers would inevitably surround the rotting corpse of Russia and cannibalize its remains, until nothing remained. However, fate had other plans.\n\nA Great Man stepped forward and shielded the Motherland from its enemies. He lifted the Russian people from poverty, returned the lands lost during the collapse, punished the traitors and degenerates and put a country now known as Eurasia at the helm of the new world order. The name of that man was Jegor Letov.\n\nFyodorov couldn't believe his eyes - in less then a decade, one man was able to bring Russia back from the brink, making it even stronger than the fallen Union, and he was a former part of the degenerate rock scene at that! Despite that, Jevgenij recognized the strength of the new Russian leader and pledged his allegiance to Letov. In 2010's Fyodorov organized a series of paramilitary movements and organizations that were focused on "preserving the sovereignty" of Eurasia, crusading against fascists, liberals and oligarchs that aimed to sabotage the presidency of Jegor Letov. In a certain ways these organizations were a reflection of Fyodorov's paranoia - after president Dmitrij Medvedev was removed from office in 2010, Jevgenij believed that the National-Bolshevik party was a nest of snakes who would undoubtedly get rid of Letov at some point for the sake of their western masters.\n\nHis worst fears came to life last year, when the president of Eurasia was brutally murdered. His assassination was declared a car accident by the traitors in Moscow, which only confirmed Fyodorov's suspicions. Gathering his militias under the banner of the "National Liberation Government" Jevgenij Alekseevich Fyodorov intends to restore order to the country and find out those responsible for the murder of his idol.§!"
