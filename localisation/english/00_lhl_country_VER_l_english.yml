 POLITICS_CHUBAIS_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WPerhaps if not for the coup of '93 and the National-Bolshevik Ballot Revolution of '96, Russia would have gone a radically different path and the name of Anatolij Borisovich Chubajs would have been known throughout the world. But after Boris Jel'tsin was deposed, Chubajs went underground, becoming the head of a small circle of liberal-minded intelligentsia. Nonetheless, the administration of Jegor Letov turned out to be surprisingly tolerant to the former market reformers, placing many of them alongside Soviet planners in the Eurasian Supreme Economic Council.\n\nFrom there on, Anatolij Borisovich has been responsible for managing the national microelectronics and nanotechnologies, building connections with many middle and upper managers who were unsatisfied with the low-profit margin they have been receiving from the state. By the late 2010s,the entire economy on the Volga river - one of the most industrialized regions of Eurasia, was under his indirect control. He could simply relax and let the money flow, and yet...\n\n...the events in Minsk and Moscow started a cascade that soon shook the whole continent. As Lukashenko, Putin, and the Moscow Government struggled to reach the Volga, Chubajs urgently declared an interim regime of his own. Now, with frontlines stagnating and his rule cemented, Chubajs can finally realize the dream he had ever since the tricolor was raised over the Kremlin, a dream of a Republic, free and prosperous like it was intended to be ever since February of 1917.§!"
