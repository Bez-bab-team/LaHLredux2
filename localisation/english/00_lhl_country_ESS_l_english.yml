 ESS_Richard_Dawkins_desc:0 "§YClinton Richard Dawkins§!\n\n§YBiography§!: Intellectual, Professor, Curator, and now Leader. That is to say, being a leader is not new to Richard Dawkins, even if his current predicament may be the toughest challenge he faced thus far.\n\nClinton Richard Dawkins was born on March 26th 1941 in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya during British colonial rule, arriving on the home isles in 1949. Despite growing up in the classical Anglican church Richard would grow to question his established reality, eventually growing distant from his faith and embracing the theory of evolution as the new religion.\n\nWith his intellectual mind of pious nature, Richard Dawkins would soon become the assistant professor of zoology at the University of California. He quickly climbed the academic career ladder and in 1995 Dawkins was appointed Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford. Richard made a name for himself in humanitarian and atheist groups slowly growing to prominence being the few to embrace anti-monarchist republican ideals.\n\nWhen the war came, the honorable professor decided not to stand silent to the call of his nation. As the walls fell around him and his college fled to the feeble-minded Eurasian puppets in the north Dawkins stood tall and strong as all respectable men of their nation should when the time comes. Starting as the curator of many humanitarian missions in the ruins of old London with the protection of Mad Max, the professor now stands as the sole leader of the Nationalist London.\n\nWhile the turbulent days of the power-struggle in the capital have passed, only when all of Britain has been saved from ignorance, poverty and war shall peace reign in the mind of Clinton Richard Dawkins. Intellectual, Professor, Curator, and now Leader."
 ESS_Nick_Land_desc:0 "Founded in the early 1990’s at the University of Warwick, the now defunct Cybernetic Culture Research Unit has nurtured many unorthodox thinkers, artists and writers – Nick Land arguably being the most notorious figure out of all of them. Starting his professional career as a lecturer and initially espousing Marxist beliefs, Land’s views changed dramatically after the formation of the CCRU.\n\nThe labyrinth of thoughts that began with the critique of Immanuel Kant and reinvention of Deleuze and Guattari culminated in an apocalyptic vision of a world dominated by decentralized autonomous flows of capital. Land foresaw a future where humanity can only watch in horror as Capitalism annihilates every traditional institution and belief and is reborn as an all-powerful Artificial Intelligence, no longer bound by the anthropomorphic limitations of its creators. The philosophy that vouched for the perpetuation of capitalist processes to the aforementioned conclusion became known as accelerationism, and Nick Land came forth as its father.\n\nThe CCRU continued to dwell into the dark depths of the foretold future, incorporating occultism and science fiction into the nascent philosophy, slowly morphing into what some described as a quasi-cultish den of madness. Much of that came from Land’s personal anti-social behavior and drug use. Ultimately, the unit was disestablished in 2003, scattering its members to the winds. Nick Land disappeared from the radar, supposedly moving to the increasingly isolationist United States and giving infrequent lectures in certain academic communities. It seemed like accelerationism would remain but a footnote in the history of English philosophy.\n\nWhen the civil war divided Britain and London was taken over by Max Mosley, nobody expected to see Nick Land as one of his lieutenants. Returning to his homeland, Land managed to impress the leader of the nationalists with his writing and found himself the ideologue of the growing movement. With his newfound position, Nick managed to locate his former CCRU associates that still remained in the United Kingdom and offer them protection. Many were reluctant to accept the help of a man that became infamous for his uncontrollable behavior. Their suspicions were only amplified when they met Land’s new co-writer – a rather notorious American publicist known as Curtis Yarvin, and yet the guarantees of relative safety and renewed academic work convinced many of them to remain in London. The CCRU was reborn.\n\nNowadays Nick Land and his colleagues toil as the idea men behind Mosley’s reign, entrenching his thuggish regime with ideological fervor. However, the dictator of London is getting old. His grasp on power may soon slip and Nick would become one of the possible successors. While such an outcome may frighten some, most reasonable Londoners hold a strong belief that Land won’t attempt to somehow implement his decades old esoteric writing as state policy, especially considering how incoherent and abstract most of it is.\n\nThat is indeed something humans strongly believe in."
 ESS_Mark_Fisher_desc:0 "Mark Fisher witnessed the 20th century conclude with a malaise of capitalism take hold of humanity and refurnish itself as the only possible path for the future. However, broken and grotesque – the soviet-style socialism still gave the world a notion that a different way was possible, but the collapse of the USSR solidified capitalist realism as the dominating world ideology. It was over – history has ended and future was cancelled. At least that how it seemed at first.\n\nThe internal contradictions of capitalism continued to grind its own gears and as disenfranchised and downtrodden turned to extremism, the world stirred. The end of the American globalist century, the rise and fall of Eurasia, communist movements rising all over the globe – the neoliberal stagnation of the early 1990’s was replaced with a chaotic blend of radicalism, conflict and ironically, hope. There were finally alternatives – however horrific and unorthodox and yet neoliberal capitalism no longer stood as the dominant ideological hegemony.\n\nAs for Fisher himself, the fires that overtook the globe reached his homeland of Britain in the 2010’s when the country’s feeble attempts to preserve the old order backfired into a full-fledged civil war. Unlike many of his intellectual peers, Mark decided to remain in the country, documenting the turbulent times of the fallen kingdom. Fisher initially envisioned himself a mere observer in the grand conflict, but fate brought him together with Nick Land, a notorious accelerationist philosopher and an old acquaintance of Mark. A long time ago both of them were members of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit in the University of Warwick, and now the eccentric lecturer managed to enter the inner circle of Max Mosley – the authoritarian leader of Greater London area. Land invited Fisher to the city, promising protection and an environment to safely conduct his studies. Reluctant at first, Mark ultimately accepted the offer, gunning for a chance to actually contribute and do good for the people of the former Great Britain.\n\nTime goes by and it hasn’t been kind to the aging Max Mosley - soon enough the struggle for his empty throne shall begin. For Mark Fisher, this is a chance. A chance to truly change Britain and the world. To shelter the English people from war and strife not with nationalism and nostalgia for a post-Thatcher Britain but with a true new alternative – something radical, uncompromising, yet beautiful, to prove that future still exists. And if Mark Fisher succeeds hope may yet survive in this chaotic and cruel world."
 ESS_Curtis_Yarvin_desc:0 "Curtis Guy Yarvin is an outsider to the world of politics within Greater London. He isn’t a military man loyal to Tim Collins, an intellectual infatuated with Richard Dawkins’ ideas or a criminal rising to serve in Max Mosley’s ranks. Curtis Yarvin isn’t even from the former United Kingdom.\n\nCurtis first gained notoriety in the United States as a blogger under the pen-name Mencius Moldbug. In his writing, Yarvin spoke of the failings of democracy, the benefits of business-style approach to state craft and of the Cathedral – the agglomeration of liberal and left-wing political and media institutions that influence the world. In the early 2010’s Yarvin began collaborating with another notorious figure – a British philosopher by the name of Nick Land, a man who created the modern concept of accelerationism. Together, they refined a collective vision of a modern state – one devoid of democracy, but one that is free from the Cathedral’s enveloping tentacles.\n\nThe quiet intellectual life of the duo was interrupted by the news of United Kingdom descending into chaos. In a very uncharacteristic move, the soft-spoken Nick decided to return to his decimated homeland – either out of a desire to see his vision prevail or a semblance of obligation towards his former comrades from the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit. Yarvin initially stayed behind – he had no interest in abandoning his work for a life-threatening adventure into the belly of the beast.\n\nHowever, as time passed and Curtis pondered, he came to a realization. While some in the United States shared his vision, the staunchly democratic and now severely isolationist country would never rid itself of the fallacy It was founded upon. The British Civil War offered a chance – a gamble to reshape the lives of millions of people and prove that his model works. The die was cast and the man once known as Mencius Moldbug sailed to the war-stricken British Isles. In his hand, Curtis Yarvin brings the torch of dark enlightenment and with it the fire that shall liberate England from death, poverty and delusion."

Nevertheless, some may say the son managed to overshadow the legacy of his father.\n\nEducated in the theory of law at Christ Church in Oxford, Mosley "successfully" applied his degree by pursuing a career in racing, earning the nickname "White Lightning". However, after two brutal accidents in 1969, Mosley decided to move away from professional racing, becoming an entrepreneur, and yet his passion for the sport didn't vanish. Ultimately Mosley's fame, accumulated fortune and experience granted him an opportunity to become head of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile.\n\nWith success came the detractors and enviers. They manufactured ridiculous sex scandals and accused Mosley of connections to the British far-right. None of that mattered, Max was always on top.\n\nIt all came crashing down when chaos came to England. Mosley’s empire fell, becoming a mere shadow of its former self. With his home city of London in chaos, and power greatly diminished, the time for radical action has come and Mosley called in some favors from a couple of old friends. In 2019 Mosley’s Nationalists bands would blitz the city of London and brought it to heel. Max now holds power over the entirety of Greater London, supported both by the brutish nationalist thugs as well as the great thinkers of the modern times such as Nick Land and Richard Dawkins. Will Mosley be able to hold the balance of power in the capital or will his empire finally collapse in the same fashion as his home country?"

However, the recent developments forced the band to abandon their “mole-like” ways. The Crimson Prince crept further north, occupying southern London and plunging its territory into chaos.

Clogged sewage, damaged control centers, destroyed dams and canals: all of this contributes to the turning of our capital into one big Waterworld. However, if there is any group that suffers more from it than we do, it is the Dark Waters, as it is already difficult to navigate in the destroyed city, but when it's also flooded it becomes impossible to swim without hitting at least few chunks debris and damaging the ship.

They often steal from civilians, rather than targeting things that we need. Overall, they're clearly a missed opportunity, and the issues they cause in their current state outweigh the benefits of their loot. As such, Max Mosley has acted to restrain and reorganize the bandit gangs in London, issuing a decree to enforce discipline, military-style hierarchy, and transform them into an assault force optimized for sabotage and raids targeting war materiel and infrastructure."

Nonetheless, a few proposals came from the gang leaders, and while idiotic ones (like constructing a uranium filled gas canisters for our Hellcannons to act as mini-nukes) were brushed aside, 2 solid ones were considered.The first is to just use dumb brute force. We have overwhelming quantity and quality, not to say that the hatred towards those royalists fuels our soldiers better than any oil or food while they are starving on men and ammunition.The second is a bit more tricky. While they all believe in Christ, they have their own sectarian divides and are ready to die for them. By reports of our spies at least a dozen differing sects and cults arose and are only held together by their hatred towards us. By making a small diversion, we can turn them against one another."

But despite all of that, their hope for the Royalists counterattack is almost gone by now.\n To finally prevent their actions in the heart of London, leaders of the local band of Dark Waters, considered for us two options on this question - To save the honor of the Tower's guards, and let them peacefully leave London up to their masters, for an obvious favor; Or just to fake a George's order to lay their arms and surrender to the local government."

 ESS_event.32.d:0 "Max Mosley was known to be the leading figure of Formula One and president of the  Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, and aside from his vast political experience and great family name, has personally set a few records on the track, making him a truly unique man in British contemporary politics. It was only natural that after the stabilization of the situation in London, our Leader would seek to revive the old event even with those humble remnants of this city's wealth. Personally overseeing it from his tribune at the center of the stadium, surrounded by the warlords and industrialists, the race started as soon as he waved his hand with a checkered flag. And while the official part went as well as 20 years ago, the racers themselves... Number 12 has completely covered his car with small spikes, including the policemen's road spikes, Number 20 has attached a giant rocket to the back and front, Number 14 has made a true monster truck comprised of many cannibalized parts of smaller cars, and so on and so forth. The race itself was quite interesting as well, for Number 12 unlocked his trunk and covered the lane in oil, causing at least 3 cars to completely crush. Number 5 has used an improvised lightning rod to completely blackout the surrounding competitors, and as a result, has shut down his car as well. Numbers 9 and 10 brought machine guns and were quickly disqualified. Numbers 8 and 2, despite coming last were so engaged in their personal race that they continued the race even after crossing the finish line, scaring the pedestrians and causing a police chase ending up with a giant car pile after one of the bridges over the Thames collapsed under their weight. But the winner turned out to be the dark horse, Number 14 was spotted dropping off many parts of his vehicle, destroying at least 5 opponents, and speeding up with every part dropped, coming just a few seconds before Number 20 caught up with his rockets. The winner was awarded 20 boxes of luxury alcohol, a stack of cash, and a personal handshake from Sir Mosley himself. While the discipline and conduct of the race leaves much to be desired, nonetheless we have managed to also find many genius minds that can be used in our workshops to construct intricate weapons."

After the death of Max Mosley and the beginning of the German siege, the situation in the city seemed extremely dire. There were genuine concerns that the death of the paramount leader would dissolve the invisible web that kept various gangs and political factions within London together and the city would succumb to internal conflict, before being fully consumed by the Hun menace. However, against all odds the nationalist movement was able to not only defeat the invaders, but to attain stability and democracy under the wise leadership of Nick Land and his fellow intellectuals.\n\nAs the new British Republic blooms, Land has stated that after a short stabilization period he will step down as the leader of the movement and proper elections will be conducted to propel England into a new era of freedom and prosperity."

 #
 ESS_event.61.t:0 "The Vanquished"
 ESS_event.61.d:0 "As we celebrate the rebirth of British democracy and the beginning of our road towards unification, the issue of the defeated German intervention force has to be addressed. The brutal occupation that these thugs inflicted upon East Anglia cannot go unpunished – most of the high-ranking individuals within the intervention force have already been put on trial. Now, it is time to decide upon the fate of the common soldiers, bureaucrats and those who were not privy to the crimes committed by Josef Maria Klumb and his cronies.\n\nDuring the interrogation of these “petty criminals” we managed to discover an important detail. Apparently, the former Norfolk government has severed any ties with Berlin several months prior to their ill-fated attempt to siege London. This was their last-ditch attempt to establish a foothold on the islands, lest they succumb to soldier mutinies and internal rebellion. Now, different members of the defeated intervention force, ranging from privates and lowly clerks to full-on generals beg our government for them to be pardoned and given political asylum – they are convinced that their misguided attempts at self-preservation will be declared treason in Germany and their days as free men will be numbered.\n\nThis is obviously a desperate plea of a doomed people for some kind of a miraculous salvation and yet some of their skills may indeed be valuable in our efforts to reunify the British Isles. As the republic stirs in endless squabbling and worthless debates, the Internal Council has proposed three possible solutions to this problem.\n\nCurtis Yarvin suggests that our government is in dire need of experienced economists and bureaucrats – those are to be covertly pardoned, while most of the interventionist military staff is to be publicly trialed as a way to boost public support\n\nNick Land has added that we should incorporate both the civilian and military officials of the defunct Norfolk government, pointing out that the “reptilian” nature of the Germans may give us an edge during the next phase of the civil war.\n\nLastly, Mark Fisher and the left-wing of the Council staunchly demand all German high-ranking officials to be either put on trial or deported back to the mainland. An exception will be made for lowly bureaucrats, administrators and soldiers who weren’t accused of committing any war crimes during the siege of London."

The Trust has isolated several promising candidates for the role of a CEO.\n\nEmma Walmsley is an succesful businesswoman with ample experience in the pharmaceutical industry. Her strong and dynamic leadership style will surely be beneficial for the long-term development of the British State.\n\nClive Palmer is an Australian expatriate, who recently arrived to Britain in search of opportunity. Taking into account his interest in coal and nickel indsutry as well a propensity for big extravagante projects, he may be the correct choice if we wish to bring England back to its glorious Victorian days.\n\nNext is Peter Thiel - a personal friend of Curtis Yarvin and an experienced IT venture capitalist. His personal interest in the philosophy that our state was founded upon may make Thiel the most suitable candidate for the job.\n\nLast but not the least is Timothy Spicer. A former general of the Sussex clique under royal prince Harry, this "soldier of fortune" found refuge in London after the collapse of the aforementioned government. His expericne as a CEO of a private military company will give us an edge in the forthcoming struggle for the British isles."

 ESS_event.101.d:0 "To Mark Fisher\nOld friend, I know you don’t see it as I do but what you are creating will lead to a manufactured failure. Capitalism is fundamentally all encompassing, even the Soviet Union needed the factories of Ford and the American philosophy of Taylorism to jump start its red project. I trust in your intellectual capacities to realize this obvious fact, perhaps the optimism of these early victories has blinded you in the pursuit of this utopian project.\nIn any case, I am to remain here and I will support you on this path, however do not forget that the final outcome of socialism is twofold: You will either follow the path of Korea and China - a post-marxist society of red capitalism or the path of the Soviets and the Eastern Bloc - destined to eventually suckle the sweet tit of capitalism, as it decomposes in real time.\nRegard,\nNick"

The nations of Venezuela , Columbia and Peru are under direct military administration of USSOUTHCOM. The occupying forces in Venezuela and Columbia are led repsectively by governor Paul Bremer and lieutenant general Jay Garner. Peru is currently under the collaborator administration, lead by president Keiko Fujimori. Despite their progress in capturing most major coastal population centers, the rest of the inland territory is still controlled by various revolutionary forces.\nThe currently known militia forces resisting occupation are as follows - "Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200" (Venezuela), "National Liberation Army" and "Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia" (Columbia), "Shining Path" (Peru).\nAs of right now, we have confirmed information that Washington has learnt of the revolution that took place on the British Isle and the current course of our government, with certain factions of the ruling Republican Party considering a military response against the Democratic Republic of England.\nIt is in our best interest that we distract Washington by reactivating this guerrilla war in South America and supply the local revolutionary forces."

 ESS_event.103.d:0 "Official report\nCentral Bank of the Democratic Republic of England\nThird Quarterly Report\nOver the past five months the Central Bank of the Democratic Republic of England has made progress in its key goal while expanding its operations and continuously countering obstacles and ever expanding challenges that seek to hinder the development of the Republic. This growth and progress is thanks to the collective leadership of the Central Bank and various govenrning subsets of England working synergistically to pursue a brighter financial future for the people of England.\nAs per the last report, national state operations debt has increased by a factor of 12 while inflation has increased by 10% in the last 12 weeks due to operation costs of the state and poor capital production. The Monetary Policy Committee’s restrictive policy stance weighs on domestic inflationary pressures. Elsewhere, the Financial Policy Committee has made progress on reducing vulnerabilities in market-based finance. The Financial Policy Committee advises to cease all major debt amassing objectives and pursue cognitive financial tasks in non competitive markets due to the current lack of capital production.\nCreditors have already shown a distinct and ever-growing disinterest in investing in our state infrastructure. This financial situation is everevolving in a non-positive direction that will eventually cycle down to a reduced amount of operations that could lead to a hostile financial situation for the administration.\nAn example of a similar situation is the collapse of the Republic of Chile under Salvador Allende and the latter fascist coup led by Augusto Pinochet and the establishement of a neoliberal state within the country."
