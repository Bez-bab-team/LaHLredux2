 POLITICS_POKLONSKAJA_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WThere are individuals in Eurasia, whose name is known and respected by each and every citizen of the vast empire. People with legendary reputations, who have proven themselves to be champions of modern history. Natal'ja Vladimirovna Poklonskaya isn’t one of them.\n\nBorn in Ukraine, Poklonskaya briefly served as an assisted attorney in Crimea, until the country was annexed by Russia in 2004. Her pro-Russian views during the crisis garnered Natal'ja a significant career boost, ultimately landing her a spot as the governor of Primor’je in 2016. Despite gaining a relatively important position in the eurasian political scene, Poklonskaya never stood out amongst her more eccentric peers, such as Boris Jel'tsin or volkhv Dobroslav. Her relatively moderate outlook and policies, only slightly sprinkled with some monarchist nostalgia paled in comparison with much more radical views of other eurasian politicians.\n\nNevertheless, the former attorney was able to greatly enhance the living standards of the Eurasian Far East in no small part thanks to the blossoming trade and cooperation with the reunited Korea. It is rumored that Poklonskaya was able to befriend the current supreme leader of the country - Kim Yo-Jong which greatly helped in the establishment of this new partnership.\n\nIn 2019, the internal struggle that started after the death of Jegor Letov finally broke the Eurasian Union apart. Poklonskaya was able to secure most of the Far East under her control, but a prisoner revolt in Kamchatka and charismatic leadership of Viktor Tsoj and Constantin Petrov tarnished the idea of quick stability in the region.\n\nNatal'ja Poklonskaya doesn’t waver, however. She has enough men and weapons to curb-stomp any unlawful resistance in the Far East, a benefactor who supports her efforts and a clear vision for the future of the country, one that may surprise those who considered her to be a simple bureaucrat without much imagination.§!"
