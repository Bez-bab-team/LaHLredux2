 POLITICS_SHOJGU_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WA Modern Zhukov, Sergej Kuzhugetovich Shojgu has earned this nickname for his heroism and for his unparalleled brutality. Meeting the rise of Eurasia as a minor officer, engagements throughout the world, from Crimea to Georgia brought him one step closer to the top of the new Russian military, with every task being completed quickly and with total annihilation of the enemy.\n\nHis hour of glory however came during the intervention in China where he commanded the Mongolian front, pushing back the remnants of PLA out of the Gobi deserts and onto the Tibetan plateau. Later on, appointed as the military attache to Mongolia, enjoying his status as a revered war hero with his chest full of medals. When troubles began in Moscow, Shojgu worried not, returning back to Russia and drawing up plans with his fellow marshals to end rebellions and secession movement quickly and without bloodshed.\n\nThose plans were tarnished, when the Supreme Commander of Siberian Military District - Lev Rokhlin was assassinated by Igor’ Strelkov and Alexandr Lebed’, seemingly distrusting Shojgu over his civilian background, prompting him to act quickly and pull his loyalists to Altaj. There he gathers an army to ravage everything from Kamchatka to Vistula, preparing a comeback of a true Eurasia.\n\nA Eurasia born in the saddle.\n\nA Eurasia forged in wars.\n\nA Eurasia fitting of its great new leader.§!"
