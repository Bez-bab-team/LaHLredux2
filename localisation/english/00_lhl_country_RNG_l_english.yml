 POLITICS_JELTSIN_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WBoris Nikolajevich Jel'tsin is a man despised by many as the one who buried all hopes for the far and distant future and praised by some as the slayer of communism. Inheriting a trait of every great Russian leader starting since Ivan the Terrible, to be both revered and hated, Jel'tsin nonetheless shaped the future of the 21st century like no one else. For without his reign in the early 90's, there would be no National-Bolshevik Party, no Jegor Letov, no reshaping of the world order, no Eurasian domination, and no subsequent Civil War.\n\nThough removed from power after the '93 putsch and effectively under house arrest since 1996, Jel'tsin still had lots of former supporters throughout Eurasia, from liberals who despised the seeming return of the old totalitarian dictatorship to nationalists who saw Letov's Eurasia as a brown Bolshevik Empire, bound to merge the Russian ethnicity with various "undesirables".\n\nWith no one to enforce the law and the violence against Russians on the edges of Eurasia spiraling up, the wide coalition of right-wing forces was quick to find themselves a force to rally behind, seizing everything north of Balkhash and Aral Sea and up to the Irtysh river, proclaiming the rebirth of Russia for Russians and in a Russian way.\n\nAnd yet, time is such a fragile thing. With frontlines stagnating and Jel'tsin's health, albeit improved thanks to his efforts of sobering up, is quickly deteriorating, this is one dream he may never live to see.§!"
