 POLITICS_ALKSNIS_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WOn the 26th of December 1991, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was dissolved. At least that is what most people tend to believe. In actuality, the great worker's paradise continues to exist, all thanks to the valiant efforts of colonel Viktor Imantovich Alksnis.\n\nHimself of Latvian descent, Alksnis was one of the soviet hardliners, who staunchly opposed the Baltic States secession movement of the 1990's. Viktor was one of the principal figures behind the notorious "Riga OMON", the police unit that attempted to put down the pro-independence rallies in Latvia, during the winter of 1991. Despite their efforts, the three Baltic countries managed to escape the Union, and Alksnis was barred from entering Latvia on a permanent basis.\n\nIt seemed like Viktor's cause was forever lost to the cruel winds of history, but fate gave the colonel another chance four years later. In 1995, with the help from the newly established national-bolshevik government of Russia, a series of break-away states with an uncanny resemblance to the unrecognized Transnistrian republic sprung up in Latvia and Estonia. Pro-Russian rebels took over the regions of Latgale and Narva, waging war against the apartheid regimes of the two Baltic countries with Viktor Alksnis as their leader.\n\nThe war lasted for the next ten years. The Estonian campaign ultimately led to the incorporation of the Narva region into Eurasia, but in Latvia Alksnis was able to fully overthrow the proto-fascist government, finally returning Latvia where it belonged. With generous funding from Eurasia Viktor became the daunting task of rebuilding the country. He re-established the soviet-style government and economic system, carving his own small Soviet Union on the Baltic coast. The colonel's vision of the world vastly differed from the more esoteric ideology of his Eurasian overlords, but that wasn't a major factor in the relationship between Latvia and the new Russia.\n\nWhen the Eurasian civil war began, Alksnis was able to keep his soviet Latvia intact. Now, as a new "1991" shakes Russia, colonel Viktor Alksnis wonders if it's finally time for the Soviet Union to properly return to the world stage.§!"
