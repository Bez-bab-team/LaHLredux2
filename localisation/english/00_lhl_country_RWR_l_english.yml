 POLITICS_KAGARLITSKIJ_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WBoris Yulyevich Kagarlitskij is somewhat of an enigma among the modern Eurasian left. For while many espoused the state as a force to be strengthened and expanded, he in contrast, argued that the state, just like Marx and Lenin wanted, must wither away It must preserve democracy, both workplace and electoral, and become a beacon of tolerance and freedom in the sea of rotting capitalist imperialism.\n\nLike many leftists, he supported the struggle against Boris Jel'tsin in 1993, yet radically condemned the rise of National-Bolsheviks. Siding with the opposition against every establishment's move, he nonetheless kept his position as a lecturer and orator. As Letov's government began inviting back former liberal economists and deregulating the economy, which the Communist Party of Eurasia supported as "a Russian way to Socialism", masses of workers gained a renewed interest in orthodox marxism, which allowed Kagarlitsky to stay afloat and build his own Labour Party thanks to massive donations.\n\nWhen chaos ensued, the workers of Kirov rose up, propelling Kagarlitsky to the top as their leader in the first elections. However, building a socialist democracy was much more difficult than first imagined. With the lack of resources leading to rationing and violence on the streets, Kagarlitysky's rule gained many opponents on the ideological field. Will the dream of Marx survive, or will his own creation once again consume itself in the fires of violence and counter-revolution is a question for another time.§!"
