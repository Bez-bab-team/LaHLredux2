 POLITICS_SVETOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WMany find Mikhail Vladimirovich Svetov to have more in common with a rock star than a statesman. This impression is based not all that much on his bright looks or his extravagant manner of speech, but on his tendency of turning politics into a show.\n\nHaving grown up in a family of classical liberals, Mikhail has long abandoned his parents’ political views and entered the National Bolshevik Party at a young age. The reasoning behind this decision had nothing to do with the utopian promises and revanchist rhetoric, but the energy, wildness and the spirit of uncompromising protest integral to the “Nazbols” of that age.\n\nAs the NBP became a stagnant, cumbersome Leviathan plagued by corruption and apathy, Mikhail refused to accept this way of things and joined one of the many discussion clubs founded by young radicals taking interest in fringe political ideas.\n\nHis oratory brilliance and charisma allowed him to quickly overshadow all the other leadership candidates, making him the hero in the eyes of the protesting youth. And while all the pompous bigwigs and haughty party players were busy squabbling and quarreling among themselves, a new movement was already steadily rising up in the party’s grassroots. A movement enamored with the ideas of Hans Hermann Hoppe, freedom of association, and the non-aggression principle.\n\nCurrently, the Ivanovo National-Bolshevik party committee led by Mikhail Svetov and unfortunately cut-off from its leader in Moscow by the radicals from RNE is undoubtedly loyal to the ideas of Yegor Letov and Alexandr Dugin. But like many things in life, loyalties tend to shift quickly and without warning.§!"
