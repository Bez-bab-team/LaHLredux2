 POLITICS_STRELKOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WA Modern Drozdovskij, Igor’ Ivanovich Strelkov carries this nickname with pride, because there is no reason to hide it. Always loyal to Russia, regardless of the colors it's wrapped in, Strelkov silently carried out any order the higher-ups gave to him, whether it were peace-keeping operations in Yugoslavia, organization of rebel action in Eastern Ukraine or reconnaissance missions in the heart of Tbilisi.\n\nLike many modern military men of Eurasia, his star hour happened during a short-lived intervention in China, where Strelkov fulfilled the lasting dream of washing his boots in the Yellow Sea. His heroic feats, ruthlessness, and lack of moderation, earned him the position of Commandant in Manchuria, which he kept just before Moscow descended into chaos, prompting him to pull out and defend Siberia.\n\nStrelkov’s stoicism and determination to keep his cool were dashed as the Commander of Siberian District - Lev Rokhlin was found dead with a bullet lodged in his head. Realizing the treachery of Alexander Lebed and Sergej Shojgu who were clearly jealous of the most cunning and youngest field marshal of the Eurasian military, he decided to walk his own path, a path of the Russian soldier, the path of Suvorov and Brusilov, a path towards the Empire that Russia was always destined to be."
