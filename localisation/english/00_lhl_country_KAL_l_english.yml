 POLITICS_ADZHIJEV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WJangurchi Bajmuradovich Adzhijev is an executive committee chairman of “Birlik” - a civic organization representing the Nogai people within the border of the Eurasian state. At least that used to be his occupation for the last ten years, until the Eurasian civil war destroyed any semblance of stability in the vast national-bolshevik empire.\n\nAt first, the native Nogai lands were overrun by the retreating forces of Vladimir Putin’s Rosgvardiya, then an alliance calling themselves the “Sanitary Cordon" incited a rebellion in the same area. Meanwhile, Adzhijev was organizing the Nogai in an attempt to protect his people, which didn’t go unnoticed by the leader of the “Cordon". After tense negotiations, Jangurchi and his organization were thrusted into the leadership role of the “Nogai Horde” - a new member of the “Sanitary Cordon”, nominally created for the protection of Nogais on the Caspian shores. In actuality this was but another way to diminish Rosgvardiya’s influence in the area, under a thin veil of legitimacy and Jangurchi Adzhijev knows this. He is fully aware that once the southern threat is gone, the other members of the “Sanitary Cordon" will no longer see him as useful and the days of Jangurchi Bajmuradovich Adzhijev will be numbered.\n\nNevertheless the leader of “Birlik” pushes forward. He is now the leader of Nogais after all and has a responsibility to protect them. Perhaps things aren’t as grim as they seem now, and with some clever maneuvering the Nogai Horde will be the last one standing at the end of the upcoming battle.§!"
