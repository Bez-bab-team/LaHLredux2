 SUS_witches_political_spirit:0 "Convent Rule"
 SUS_witches_political_spirit_desc:0 "The Convent Rule is a system of public policies implemented by the members of Convent who were initially part of the Amazonian Royal Guards. Their goal is to prepare the the British public for its own emancipation from the outlived backward institutions such as family. This would turn the country into the Utopia where no human can trample other or not a single soul would tremble upon seeing luxury."
 SUS_witches_army_spirit:0 "Egalitarian Stratocracy"
 SUS_witches_army_spirit_desc:0 "Military reforms of the People's Kingdom turned the army from the opressive and constantly consuming intstution into the force that unites the people of the country in one single goal to protect the Motherland and is able to be productive to cover all the material expenses caused by the necessity of military forces. Renewed army specialises on the wide use of the special forces that allow to destabilize enemy ranks."

The time to choose the next leader of the Secret Intelligence Service has come. There are two main candidates that Sir Dearlove has chosen to be his successor.\n\nThe first candidate is Richard Tomlinson - a former MI6 agent with plenty of experience. While he was dismissed from the agency in 1995 under false charges, his years of service for the crown and many feats, including the rescue of Princess Diana from the assassination attempt by Prince Charles, make him a great candidate to be the new chief of MI6.\n\nThe second choice is Sir Richard Branson - a well-known business magnate and philanthropist. Branson possesses a large network of connections, unregistered funds in offshore accounts, and expertise in world-wide trade and commerce. While he doesn't have any experience with work related to MI6, his other skills may prove very useful in our return to the world stage."

No signs of resistance to these acts have been recorded by eyewitnesses in Portsmouth yet. All the roads in and out of the city are blocked by the armed forces vehicles. Our reporters tried to engage with the officers on the place but they asked us politely to leave and wait for the coming announcement from the King himself.The alleged coup attempt seem to be a sign of the conclusion of what the Provisional Government of Sussex has been preparing for the public since the victory of the forces of the Henry IX over the South. We can no longer ignore brewing contradictions  within the stafe as they almost cost the life of our King. Such signs of the race for power in the Kingdom we first seen as the investigation into the question of the assassination attempt on the monarch swiftly found the group of interest and openly published the results of this inquiry. And it seems that the remaining party within the Court decided to ask the King's consent for the full assumption of power.\n\nThis raises the question.
