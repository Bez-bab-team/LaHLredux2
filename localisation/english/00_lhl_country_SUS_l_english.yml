But as Crown Agents increased their presence, most of the re-established trainways were occupied by their humanitarian missions. As they want to increase the effectiveness of their operations and to centralise our terminally ill mass transport, Crown Agency obligates us directly transfer control over all of the British railroads under their administration.\nAs one of the parts of our mutual contract states - \n''Recepient guarantees that any requested kind of transport* would be transfered under the Agency's jurisdiction up untill the end of the local humanitarian mission.''\n\n''*Which involves - automobile transport, ferry boats, railway locomotives and carriages, local and international aircrafts.
