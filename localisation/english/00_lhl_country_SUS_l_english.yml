 SUS_richard_dearlove_desc:0 "§YSir Richard Billing Dearlove§! §!\n\n§YBiography§!: Richard Dearlove, a man if you knew you were important and if you didn't you wouldn't matter.\n\nSir Richard Billing Dearlove (born 23 January 1945) was born at Gorran Haven, Cornwall to Jack Dearlove, the prestigious 1948 Olympic silver medallist in rowing. He received his formal education at Monkton Combe School as well as his Secondary school education at the Kent School in Kent, Connecticut. Later in life he attended Queens' College, Cambridge, and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in history. In 1966 he joined MI6 and later in 1999, he was appointed as the head Intelligence officer for the agency.\n\nBut with the rise of Eurasia, the United Kingdom fell into disarray culminating in the complete collapse of the British government with separatists and warlords grasping at the rotting corpse like maggots.\n\nHe knew his position and his expertise could tip the balance for whom he would submit and as a man of honor and respect, he chose the most logical conclusion with the Sussex Government. He became the unofficial Speculatores for Sussex with an open ear on the throne and eyes in all dark corners of his realm.\n\nNow though with chaos once more consuming the lands he calls home, he has stepped up as the “Wartime Minister” to bring peace to the kingdom and to have it United Once more."

There are two main candidates that Sir Dearlove has chosen to be his successor.\n\nThe first candidate is Richard Tomlinson - a former MI6 agent with plenty of experience. While he was dismissed from the agency in 1995 under false charges, his years of service for the crown and many feats, including the rescue of Princess Diana from the assassination attempt by Prince Charles, make him a great candidate to be the new chief of MI6.\n\nThe second choice is Sir Richard Branson - a well-known business magnate and philanthropist. Branson possesses a large network of connections, unregistered funds in offshore accounts, and expertise in world-wide trade and commerce. While he doesn't have any experience with work related to MI6, his other skills may prove very useful in our return to the world stage."

Our primary evidence includes eyewitness testimony from staff of the local Common Resource Pools, and witness statements that collectively demonstrate the defendant's involvement in these illicit activities. Our forensic accounting team has traced various transactions from distributors of linen and cotton to the defendants along with this our investigation team found multiple bootleg printing plates used to assist in the manufacturing of these counterfeit Coupon  notes.\n\nFurthermore, evidence defendants also kept a detailed record of how many counterfeit coupons they printed each week leading up to a total of 2045 counterfeit coupons printed from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX the date of raid on their concealed facility.\n\nThis case is brought under the People's Property Act which prohibits the production of state coupons by non approved manufacturers.Under the People's Property Act, two elements must be proven. First, there was knowing involvement and complacency of the production of counterfeit coupons second is the involvement in using and distributing these counterfeit coupons under the guise of being approved legal tender.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence we present today establishes a case against the defendants for the manufacturing and distribution of counterfeit coupons.

Those agents will be used to secretly blend in with the locals.

Firstly, the island now has its own "Home Defence" forces that only comply with the orders of mayor of Douglas who is yet to be reached by our agents. Secondly, our operatives located a lengthy construction site being inspected by local officials. Later we uncovered its purpose. The complete lack of national speed limits, rough curvy roads, and it's proximity to the British mainland used to make Isle of Man an international hotspot for motorbike races. The famous ''Isle of Man Tourist Trophy'' had been held here since 1907, only being canceled due to World wars and the current British instability. This changed when the new ''British Government Authority'' suddenly decided to host a new event, pretending like nothing wrong happened with the rest of Britain. We cannot miss such an opportunity to profit off the international pool of potential recruits and informants among tourists and participants, and learn motives for this feast in time of plague, as they can involve some fraudulent interests.\n\nOur cell also informs us that participation in the race would greatly help our agents to legitimize themselves under the ''British Government Authority'' and avoid unnecessary losses amongst our agents. For this purpose we will disguise ourselves as potential sponsors and participants of the race from Ireland with a goal of establishing further economic ties with local government and maybe even make some exclusive deals. The first ferryboat from Dublin to Man is going to have exactly thirty of our most loyal personnel, whose roles would range from sponsors and common tourists all the way up to direct race participants. Every possible scenario has been thought through, from marketing deals gone wrong, up to a possible scenario of one of our racers coming in first place, and how an agent should tragically fake his death to avoid disclosure of his identity in such a case."

He didn't answer our questions regarding the current situation on the mainland, but he left something else for us. The mayor provided contacts of his associates to discuss further economic cooperation. One of our semi-experimental techniques which was used during the current operation is the so-called "Phone bombing", method which utilizes an unstoppable barrage of highly provocative phone calls, that are supposed not only to temporarily overload the target's phone lines, but also mentally offend and provoke them, by using technical marvels of software voice mimicking and advanced psychology.\n\nWe expected that usage of such technology in Man would be much harder then our previous tests, due to the rock-hard ability of the local officials to stick to their "provisional administration" story without flinching, but it turned out not to be the case, albeit for a completely unexpected reason.\n\nNo matter how our ''pranksters'' tried to provoke and mentally break any members of Douglas' administration, in response, we only received something akin to a broken record. No mention of current political events, fate of the kingdom's monarchs, or any political party provoked a proper understandable response. The “authorities” only talked about how the ''British Government Authority has everything under control'' and ''There is no panic on the Island''. Even our brightest minds could not find the cause behind such behavior, other then ''Some local pacifist officials' plot'' or ''Psychotraumatical memory blockade''.\n\nThis Sisyphean wave of phone calls is already tiring our prank callers but some of veterans our intelligence service reached out us and proposed that we should go through our archives of trigger phrases that were once used in the Conservatives propaganda in 2000's They claim that the way bureaucrats act towards these insults is way too stoic as if they were under influence of something and only a key words can unlock them."

Although they didn't say much aside from praising our efforts to reconstruct the United Kingdom and promises to provide "Home Defence" for our efforts, they did mention that the populace of the Isle also doesn't really know what's going on with the rest of Britain.\nThis was particularly apparent at the small settlement of Foxdale.\n\nThe locals there were completely apolitical on all possible matters. Every attempt to start a political discussion with the locals was met with absolute silence or visible disgust and open hatred. Even such mundane things as local or international news were met with reactions ranging from complete boredom to an offer of switching the topic. This uncanny psychological pattern was present among all stratas of Foxdale's population, no matter the gender, age, ethnic background or music tastes.\n\nAfter hearing about this anomaly our Ministry of Health proposed to directly observe this behavior by our most competent psychologists on the mainland in order to prevent the local population from being taken advantage of by foreign actors aware of this weakness. To do so, a fake cruise tour to France should take place, which is planned to depart from Dublin, travel to Douglas (where few of Foxdale residents would enjoy their free ride, due to being random lucky ones who had received a ''You won!'' phone call.), and after that, head to the French mainland. Halfway through, the cruise ship must stop at Plymouth's main port to resupply, giving tourists some time to visit local landmarks.\n\nMoorhaven Hospital would be the perfect place to be randomly visited by Foxdale's residents, and tour guides are going to make sure to give them the warmest welcome possible."

All of them mentioned a place called ''Roman History Museum'' that appeared about a year ago. According to them, a visit to this establishment resulted in some sort of dizziness that lasted for two days. They never mention what exactly they have been doing there and this raised even more questions.\n\nLater, our operatives managed to locate this building using directions given by the residents. When our men observed the crowd near the establishment, it became clear that the visitors left their sobriety inside this ''Museum''. Suspicions of a possible illegal bar were quickly disregarded - the visitors never came back twice, and the establishment didn't receive any "patrons" past the usual working hours. Additionally, most of the museum's guests displayed unusual symptoms - apathy, depression, memory loss and signs of a tachypsychia.  Similar effects can be observed after the consumption of low-grade alcohol, but we were unable to detect any physiological changes, such as part vision loss, or symptoms of methanol poisoning.\n\nThe unusual name of the facility stood out as foreign to the island, considering that the Isle of Man was never colonized by the Romans, and the island would have no need for a separate museum dedicated to this period. This only confirmed the theory, that the "museum" was created by someone from the mainland, who had no interest in local culture or history.\n\nr cells proposed to infiltrate the facility by performing a raid, using agents who managed to disguise themselves as local law enforcement. To help them some of our men could mine the entrance to the building and report a possible bombing threat, making sure no bystanders will interfere with a tedious inspection of the ''Museum''. This potentially will let us finally get to the bottom of this mystery."

 SUS_event.82.t:0 "Operation "Adam's Blue" - Total Success"
 SUS_event.82.d:0 "At [GetDateText] British Government Authority and Prime Minister Richard Dearlove reached an agreement by which the Isle of Man was recognized as a sovereign state and would become an ally of the United Kingdom. This opens a window for military and economic cooperation between the two government in an ongoing turmoil within Britain. Both nations agreed to guarantee each other's security as the mainland invests into expanding the Manx Home Defence and the island provides a place for more naval and military bases. Manx and Sussex troops march together on the streets of Douglas to celebrate the agreement and more entrepreneurs from Britain pour to the Isle, setting up their branches there, reconnecting the Isle of Man with the mainland.\n\nThis news shocked other political players in Britain as no one has a clear explanation of this political gesture from Richard Dearlove. Many believe this will weaken the positions of Portsmouth but it is expected that it might be a part of some scheme that will be used to defeat the remaining opponents of Sussex.\n\nBefore the agreement was signed, some rumors about the medical facility in Douglas hidden under a historical museum that had a serious accident that allegedly caused erratic behavior of the islanders, reached the rest of England. When these speculations got to the UK’s government a special commission was opened to make an inquiry into the matter. Investigation results concluded that such erratic behavior amongst the locals was caused by psychotraumatic memory losses caused by the lack of information coming from the Isle about the ongoing civil war that leaves people with no answers regarding the well-being of their relatives.\n\nNow with the matter of the Isle of Man resolved, we can safely say that Britain is one step closer towards peace."

The waking of the monarch amidst the uncertainty in which the country is due to his illness made officials fall in a way bigger silence than they were since the moment Henry IX lost his consciousness.\n\nMeanwhile there are new reports of unidentified armed militians, with no insignia whatsoever, encircling the military hospital. No signs of resistance to these acts have been recorded by eyewitnesses in Portsmouth yet. All the roads in and out of the city are blocked by the armed forces vehicles. Our reporters tried to engage with the officers on the place but they asked us politely to leave and wait for the coming announcement from the King himself.The alleged coup attempt seem to be a sign of the conclusion of what the Provisional Government of Sussex has been preparing for the public since the victory of the forces of the Henry IX over the South. We can no longer ignore brewing contradictions  within the stafe as they almost cost the life of our King. Such signs of the race for power in the Kingdom we first seen as the investigation into the question of the assassination attempt on the monarch swiftly found the group of interest and openly published the results of this inquiry. And it seems that the remaining party within the Court decided to ask the King's consent for the full assumption of power.\n\nThis raises the question. Who actually controls the Provisional Government?"

 SUS_HMB_LEADER_IMAGE_1:0 "§YRichard John Charles Tomlinson §!\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hamilton, New Zealand, Richard John Charles Tomlinson was raised in the nearby town of Ngāruawāhia.In a family of three brothers, he held the middle child position. His father, originating from a Lancashire farming family, was employed by the Ministry of Agriculture. The couple met during their studies in agriculture at Newcastle University.\n\nIn 1968, the family relocated to the village of Armathwaite in Cumbria, England. Richard Tomlinson, during his youth, earned a scholarship to attend the independent Barnard Castle School in County Durham. There, he shared his school years with future England rugby internationals Rory Underwood and Rob Andrew. Demonstrating exceptional proficiency in mathematics and physics, Tomlinson secured another scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1981.Dissatisfied with his desk job, Tomlinson sought a more fulfilling path and joined the Territorial Army in September 1989. Following successful selection, he served as a reservist in the SAS, initially with the Artists Rifles and later with 23 SAS. During this period, he earned qualifications as a military parachutist and radio operator. Tomlinson's adventurous spirit led him to represent Britain in the 1990 Camel Trophy, where he competed in Siberia, and he undertook a solo motorcycle journey across the Sahara desert. Embracing the challenges, he found the experience enjoyable, prompting him to apply to join MI6. Officially becoming a member of the service on September 23, 1991, Tomlinson completed his training with MI6 and asserted his prowess as the top recruit on his course, earning the rarely bestowed "Box 1" attribute from his instructing officers, including Nicholas Langman.\n\nAll of this would come to a change on August 31, 1997 when Tomlinson became aware of a plot to assassinate Diana, Princess of Wales. Using his position in the MI6 he would leak the documents before quickly going into hiding in the welsh countryside. After the break out of the British civil war he would establish communications with the Sussex Government in order to obtain official protection from the unofficial Sussex government secret service led by Richard Dearlove."
 SUS_HMB_LEADER_IMAGE_2:0 "§YSir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson§!\n\n§YBiography§!:Born on July 18, 1950, Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson is a prominent British business magnate, commercial astronaut, and former convict. During the 1970s, he played a key role in the co-founding of the Virgin Group, a conglomerate that presently oversees over 400 companies across diverse industries.\n\nDisplaying entrepreneurial aspirations from an early age, Branson embarked on his first business venture at 16 with the creation of a magazine called Student. By 1970, he established a mail-order record business. The entrepreneurial spirit continued as he inaugurated a chain of record stores, later known as Virgin Megastores, under the Virgin Records brand in 1972. Throughout the 1980s, the Virgin brand experienced rapid growth with the launch of Virgin Atlantic airline and the expansion of the Virgin Records music label. In 1997, Branson founded the Virgin Rail Group, participating in the bid for passenger rail franchises amid the privatization of British Rail.\n\nThe Debaucherous Sakellarios playboy, entrepreneur, visionary and all around connected individuals that is who he is. So when the civil war broke out in 2017 he contacted King Henry the 9th with an offer he couldn't refuse. He would provide criminal connections across the globe, technology, researchers and his plentiful coffers in exchange for the measly price of giving a blind eye to his less honorable activities."
