 POLITICS_KOZITSYN_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WAmong the pantheon of Russian heroes, Cossacks take a special place. And among the Cossacks Nikolaj Ivanovich Kozitsyn takes a special role of his own. An ataman of the Don Cossack Host, he always flirted with the idea of the free riders becoming something more than a cavalry auxiliary of the Russian army.\n\nThough initially flirting with separatist ideas in the mid-90’s, Kozitsyn was smart enough to rebrand himself as a true Eurasian patriot to avoid the wrath of Solar Vozhd, and the second Decossackization. Throughout the years his men distinguished themselves in Ukraine, Georgia, and China, earning cossacks a number of privileges and a dozen of medals on Kozitsyn's chest. Yet this was just a ruse that quickly fell as Letov bit the dust.\n\nKozitsyn finally got the "vol’nitsa" his people yearned for. But with every passing day, as Vladimir Putin's forces crawl closer and the Sanitary Cordon looks ever more unstable, he asks himself a question: What’s next? What will the next day bring? Will he repeat the fate of Pyotr Krasnov or Kuz’ma Krjuchkov or will his men ride as far as no cossack has ridden before?§!"
