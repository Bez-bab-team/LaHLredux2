 POLITICS_PETROV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WThe reasons behind the current Eurasian civil war are a highly debated topic among the citizens of the fallen country. Most see it as a tragic finale to a series of unfortunate events that started with the death of Jegor Letov. Some believe it to be an expected result of incompetent leadership that plagued Eurasia for years. Constantin Pavlovich Petrov knows better. The collapse of his dear Motherland is the work of the hidden, immeasurably influential powers that wish to see Russia destroyed and sought to do so for hundreds of years.\n\nDuring the times of the Soviet Union Petrov was a relatively unremarkable major-general in the Soviet armed forces. Together with some like-minded individuals Constantin was privately developing a theoretical platform titled "Concept of Public Security" that delved deep into the essence of geopolitics, theology, human consciousness and various other topics. The general's concept was supposed to help Russian civilization survive in the upcoming dystopian future manufactured by the nearly omniscient "Global Predictor".\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Eurasian State, the general attempted to convince the new government to adopt the concept, claiming it to be essential for the further development of the country. Moscow politely, yet firmly rejected what they believed to be paranoid ramblings of an aging military man, and retired Petrov to the Far East, away from any political relevance. This however didn't stop the eager leader of the newly formed Conceptual Party "Unity" and soon enough most of the political elites from Vladivostok to Chita were aware of Petrov's ideas.\n\nSoon enough, the civil war enveloped Eurasia and when Constantin Petrov proclaimed the government of "Holy Just Synodic Russia" dozens of local governors and military men pledged their allegiance to the general. However, Petrov is a very old man now and if CPU truly wishes to defeat the "Global Predictor" someone else will have to take his place soon.§!"
