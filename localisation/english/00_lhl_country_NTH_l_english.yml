 ##LEADERS##
 POLITICS_FOX_DESC:0 "Claire Fox is an important pillar of the Republican cause, and perhaps without her the future of new England could have never been achieved. Fox’s tireless work as a minister of foreign affairs saved the movement after the funding from Eurasia collapsed alongside the Moscow regime itself - Claire was able to accumulate sufficient funding from unknown, yet very generous sources.\n\nFox’s past is equally impressive - her work in the Revolutionary Communist Party and fierce struggle against the deceitful bourgeois mass-media paints this heroic woman as a true revolutionary.\n\nUltimately it was Claire Fox who saw through the platitudes of George Galloway and organized his removal from the leadership role, saving the glorious Republican revolution.\n\nSome, of course, will disagree. They will tell you that nobody actually knows which activities Claire Fox pursued after the collapse of the Revolutionary Communist Party and prior to the beginning of the civil war - all records of her public life were mysteriously expunged from the remaining archives.\n\nSome will gossip that her enlistment in the movement was purely opportunistic and not driven by any ideological convictions - Fox just happened to be living in Manchester when the revolution began.\n\nSome will speak of the questionable reforms she has pursed, ones with a very loose connection to the ideas of communism or Eurasianist national-bolshevism.\n\nLastly, some will whisper that she helped remove Galloway not out of desire to preserve the revolution but due to her own personal agenda.\n\nBut some should learn to keep their mouths shut, lest their words reach the ears of Claire Regina Fox - a great revolutionary, a genius diplomat and an unsurpassed stateswoman of the Republican cause."
 POLITICS_ANDERSON_DESC:0 "Many fellow party members genuinely wonder how Lee Anderson managed to get the position he currently occupies within the Republican government.\n\nIt is known that he was born in a small village of Huthwaite and began his career working as a coal miner, joining the Labor Party soon after. Despite Anderson's humble beginnings, there are rumors that he was able to meet some powerful people within the party and even suggest certain reforms Labor was able to implement prior to the collapse of the country.\n\nWhen the Kingdom was torn asunder by the tides of war, Anderson was supposedly still working as a Labour councilor in his home district of Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. From that point on, information concerning Anderson's actions during the civil war is sparse and often inaccurate. There are rumors he tried to establish conflict with almost every single party engaged in the war, slowly but surely accumulating capital in mysterious ways. In 2019 Anderson made his way towards the Republican stronghold of Manchester, swiftly making a positive impression on George Galloway with his immense talents. Soon enough Lee was granted the position of industry minister within the Republic.\n\nOnce Galloway has revealed his spinless nature and inability to lead the Republican cause forward, Anderson silently agreed to depose the leader alongside other, more radical members of the inner circle.\n\nMany fellow party members still wonder how Lee Anderson managed to get the position he currently occupies within the Republican government. After all, while a committed follower of the cause and one whose talents were supposedly recognized by Galloway,  Anderson doesn't seem as spectacular or extravagant as many other members of the inner circle.\n\nFor now at least, that appears to be the case"
 POLITICS_MURRAY_DESC:0 "Born to an aristocratic, yet left-leaning Scottish family in 1958, Andrew Murray followed in his family's footsteps and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain at the age of eighteen. From that point on, he became a staunch communist of the extremely authoritarian variety. Murray actively participated in labor activism, organizing strikes and finding new followers for the red cause. The collapse of the Soviet Union seemingly shattered Andrew’s belief in the quick victory of communism, but his faith in the cause didn’t waver for even a second. The rise of Eurasia in place of the once mighty soviet state was met by Murray with mixed feelings – the once steadfast worker’s paradise was replaced with an authoritarian quasi-nationalist regime, and yet Moscow’s continued struggle against the neoliberal fascists in Europe and America painted them as a force that was worth fighting for. For the next twenty years Andrew Murray worked to establish contacts with Eurasian authorities, secretly hoping that the likes of Limonov would overturn those of Dugin and Letov.\n\nMeanwhile on the Home Isles trouble was stirring as the country was slowly falling apart. By 2017 it was obvious that United Kingdom was dead – its regions seceding or falling into anarchy. In an attempt to find refuge in these dire times, Murray and his comrades in the Communist Party aligned themselves with the emerging Republican cause lead by George Galloway. In Manchester Murray worked tirelessly as the republican minister of labor, slowly gaining the trust and mutual respect of Galloway. When the latter was deposed by the inner-circle, the former trade unionist was shocked to his very core and yet he couldn't do anything against the unanimous decision made by his comrades.\n\nNow Andrew Murray is the only one trying to keep the legacy of old George Galloway alive as he carefully maneuvers the political intrigue within the Republic. Once the internal troubles have been settled  Murray will make sure the British people are finally free both from the shackles of capital as well as the degenerate culture that led them towards the path of self-destruction and misery in the first place."
 POLITICS_JARVIS_DESC:0 ""I am not going to start World War Three for you" - such were the words of platoon commander Daniel Owen Woolgar Jarvis to general Mike Jackson during the small 1996 Russia-NATO standoff in Bosnia. It is indeed ironic, how things turned out in the end - for the past two years the former soldier of the British armed forces was fighting with those same Russians against his former NATO compatriots - those who took the mantles of warlords or short-lived governments and terrorized the people of Northern England.\n\nDan Jarvis' military career came hand in hand with his participation in the Labor party politics - that was a different kind of struggle, but in many ways one much more honorable than his deployments in the Balkans or Japan. When war was brought home after the collapse of the central government Jarvis didn't have to think long before joining the republican movement in Manchester led by George Galloway. The wealthy bigwigs and the Royal Family have long since abandoned the wishes and troubles of the common people of England and it was time to remind them of their duties.\n\nThe Republicans were overjoyed to see a competent military men in their ranks, especially considering the shortage of officers and overreliance on Eurasian military expertise. Jarvis was almost instantly promoted to the position of defense minister. Dan's efforts in this position were instrumental to the survival of the republicans after the Eurasian aid was cut to the statelet in 2019.\n\nThe removal of George Galloway from power was met my Jarvis with sadness combined with quiet understanding - you cannot win a civil war without fighting.\n\nNow the road to the unification of England and perhaps the entirety of Great Britain is open and Dan Jarvis shall do everything in his power to bring freedom and equality to the people of the Isles and protect them, so neither a civil nor a world war shall ever come to Britain again."
 POLITICS_YAQOOB_DESC:0 "Ever since the beginning of the civil war, many international observers as well as those within Britain have painted the Republican movement as fringe radicals - an attack dog of the Eurasian regime that will destroy what remains of Great Britain if they take over the country.\n\nSalma Yaqoob, on the other hand, doesn't think the Manchester government goes far enough in their desires to completely restructure the society of the former United Kingdom. Engaged in the politics from the early 00's, even leading her own left-wing party Yaqoob joined the Republican movement almost immediately after its creation. Salma stayed with George Galloway through thick and thin, ultimately becoming the finance minister of the Manchester government and making it into the leader's inner circle.\n\nNevertheless, the newly appointed minister started having doubts concerning the ideological course the movement was taking. Both communism and Eurasian national-bolshevism were fascinating in their own regard, however both eventually fell. If the British revolution were to achieve success, it will have to forge its own path - one built upon a distinctive worldview system and cultural policy - similar to Eurasianism conceptually, but different in its specifics.\n\nSalma Yaqoob was one of most eager proponents of George Galloway's dismissal, despite their years long friendship, personal affairs can never overshadow the importance of revolutionary matters.\n\nThe path ahead is clear. Soon enough Salma's personal ideas may become revolutionary theory, and then Britain and everyone beyond - from Paris to Moscow shall tremble in face of her glorious revolution."
 POLITICS_GALLOWAY_DESC:0 "Born in 1954, the life of George Galloway was fully dedicated to his unrelenting struggle against western capitalism and its imperial conquests. His relentless critique of Israel, NATO and the European Union have made him a notorious name amongst the British political scene. With the collapse of the Soviet Union many hoped Galloway would abandon his now seemingly worthless struggle, however the resurgence of Eurasia lifted the spirits of George higher than they ever were before. The socially conservative anti-western state effortlessly breaking all existing political norms and conventions felt like a dream come true to Galloway, and he eagerly cooperated  with Moscow, receiving substantial funds for the establishment of pro-Eurasian media channels within Britain and the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world.\n\nSome may accuse George Galloway of being the one to bring the civil war to the British shores - supposedly it was his Eurasian benefactors that infiltrated the Kingdom through his media organizations, yet all of that is clearly false. The collapse of Britain was predetermined by the rotten institutions it was built upon. When the inevitable happened Galloway quickly gathered his loyal followers in the northern stronghold of Manchester and established a republican government. With generous Eurasian funding and specialists pouring in the country it seemed like Galloway’s victory was all but assured.\n\nIt was George’s own kindness and pacifism that robbed him of a quick victory. Desiring not to repeat the barbaric actions of western states Galloway sought to peacefully negotiate with other sides of the civil war, only using violence when absolutely necessary. These diplomatic games lasted for months ending with the once powerful Eurasian regime falling and the stream of aid coming to an end.\n\nThe revolution is in danger - if Galloway would prove incapable of liberating his homeland, a new charismatic leader may have to come forth and do it for him."

 albionflw.1.t:0 "Play on Words"
 albionflw.1.d:0 "The government of George Galloway  announced a series of new reforms aimed at further transformation of Allbion on the path of Progress and Development. A new object of attention of the Republicans became the “inefficient and outdated” Latin alphabet, which is going to be replaced with a “clearly superior” Cyrillic Alphabet, mainly used in Eastern European countries and former Eurasia. The transition was announced to the public in a speech by Galloway in which he orated about the downsides of the Latin alphabet such as it being a mark of Germanic occupation of English people, its poor ability to express emotions and the low count of letters, which are incapable of delivering many sounds the English language possesses. Galloway also talked about the deep connection inhabitants of British Isles have to Saints Cyril and Methodius, the founders of the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nRivals of the Republicans did not miss the chance to once again blame their Vozhd for being traitor to the English folk and even called him a “Russian mongrel”.\n\nAt this moment, it is impossible to tell if such a drastic decision would have any success on the British soil. One can be said for sure though. If George Galloway is to gain control of the former Great Britain, the nation's language would never be the same again."

 albion.41.t:0 "Sabotage!"
 albion.41.d:0 "Unknown elements within our state have been spreading propaganda about our "unsavory" dealings with Eurasian authorities. This have lowered the morale of our troops and population. We suspect a rival English government is responsible for these rumors."
 albion.41.a:0 "Investigate this."
 #
 albion.42.t:0 "Dismissal"
 albion.42.d:0 "Something unimaginable just mere months ago has recently come to pass. The formerly permanent leader of the Republican movement - George Galloway has been deposed from his position by an unanimous vote of the Council of Ministers. The inner-circle has cited Galloway's unwillingness to compromise his pacifist stance on the continuation of the civil war, as well as the supposed attempts to establish contact with counterrevolutionary "Black Army of Britain" elements in Central England as the deciding factors for his dismissal. Rumors of potential criminal and treason charges against George Galloway appear to be unfounded, as the newly established Provisional Government assured the populace that the former revolutionary leader was simply retired and will no longer participate in the politics of the Republic.\n\nThe aforementioned Provisional Government is currently under the temporary control of five major republican ministers and shall remain in power until proper elections take place."
